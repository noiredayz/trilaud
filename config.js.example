/* 
 * oauth code must be an "implicit flow" code. Do not use server or renewable
 * codes, this application is not designed to work with those.
 * DO NOT INCLUDE "oauth:" at the start of the code. Kod only Okayeg !
 * triLaud will figure out your identity (nick, display name and user ID)
 * from the code.
 * 
 * clientid must be the Client ID of the application you used to get your oauth.
 * I recommend using https://noiresbot.noiredayz.link/trilaud
 * The login there will generate an oauth code with only the required
 * permissions and not any more.
 * If you wish to keep using twitchapps.com/tmi their client ID is
 * q6batx0epp608isickayubi39itsckt
 * 
 * sounds must be wav files. You can use absolute or relative paths.
 * Leave the settings empty ("") if you don't want dink-donk.
 * For long Windows paths remember to double the slashes!
 * YES: C:\\sounds\\bing.wav
 * NO: C:\sounds\bing.wav
 * 
 * You can use the supplied beepbeep.wav file
 *
 * Date formats:
 * YMD for 2021-12-27 year-month-day (default if it's non-set or set to an invalid value)
 * DMY for 27-12-2021 day-year-month
 * MDY for KKonaW 12-27-2021 month-day-year format
